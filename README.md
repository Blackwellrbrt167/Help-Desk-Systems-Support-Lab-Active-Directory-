# Help Desk & Systems Support Lab Portfolio
Overview

This repository documents hands-on labs that simulate real-world Help Desk and IT Support environments. The focus is on practical, job-ready skills rather than theoretical knowledge, with clear documentation, screenshots, and validation steps that reflect how work is performed in production support roles.

The lab environment combines identity management, infrastructure administration, and service desk operations to demonstrate how enterprise IT systems function together.

# Section 01 – Active Directory Labs
Overview

This section demonstrates foundational Active Directory administration skills aligned with real-world Help Desk and IT Support responsibilities. The environment simulates a small enterprise domain where user accounts, organizational units, group policies, and authentication workflows are managed using Microsoft Active Directory.

The goal of this lab is to show practical experience with identity management, domain services, and policy enforcement as they are used in day-to-day support operations.

All actions are documented with screenshots, structured walkthroughs, and validation steps.

Lab Objectives

The objectives of this lab are to:

Establish a functional Active Directory domain environment
Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services
Promote a Windows Server to a Domain Controller
Design a logical Organizational Unit (OU) structure
Manage users, groups, and group membership
Apply and scope Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
Validate domain authentication and policy enforcement

Environment Overview

The lab environment consists of:

A Windows Server configured as a Domain Controller
A Windows client joined to the domain
DNS configured for domain name resolution
Organizational Units structured by business function
User and group objects managed through Active Directory Users and Computers
Group Policy applied at the OU level

This setup mirrors common Help Desk and Tier 1–2 support environments.

# Section 02 – osTicket Help Desk Labs
Overview

This section focuses on IT service desk operations using the osTicket ticketing system. The lab simulates a real Help Desk environment where tickets are created, assigned, worked, escalated, and resolved using structured workflows.

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate hands-on experience with ticketing systems, role-based access control, and operational support processes used by Help Desk and IT Support teams.

# Lab Objectives

The objectives of this lab are to:

Deploy an Ubuntu Server for Help Desk operations
Install and configure a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP)
Install and secure the osTicket application
Configure Help Desk system settings and departments
Create agent roles with scoped permissions
Simulate real-world support ticket scenarios
Validate ticket lifecycle handling and system functionality

# How These Labs Work Together

Active Directory provides the identity and authentication foundation used in enterprise environments.
osTicket represents the operational layer where users submit requests and IT staff manage support workflows.

Together, these labs demonstrate how infrastructure and service operations function as a unified system in real-world IT environments.

Intended Audience

# This portfolio is intended for:

Help Desk and IT Support roles
Entry-level Systems Administration roles
Students learning enterprise IT environments
Recruiters and hiring managers reviewing hands-on experience

# Next Steps

This portfolio will continue to expand with additional labs covering:

Ticketing system integration with Active Directory
Password reset and account lockout workflows
